# 👋 Hi, I’m @OpenShadowLab 

I'm passionate about technology and engineering, especially where they intersect to create useful and engaging tools.

## 👀 Interests

I'm a **Software Engineer** focused on the web. I enjoy building **Open Source** soulution and but also **SaS** that solve people's problèms. I also occasionally use **C++**, which I find enjoyable, though I'm still deepening my skills with it.

Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with **IoT devices**, exploring new areas of **software engineering**, and learning about everything from **AI and AR/VR** to **Networking**.

What drives me is creating tools and apps that are *fun to use* and *fun to build*.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I enjoy reverse-engineering old gadgets just to see how they tick — sometimes I even manage to put them back together again.
